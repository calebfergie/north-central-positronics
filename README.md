## App Setup & Tips
Created with node.js/express and automatically deployed to Heroku using the [node-js-getting-started](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) guide, [example app](https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started), and [GitHub integration guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration).

I also added [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to develop with greater ease locally.

For ease of heroku configuration, I also set the 'heroku.remote' key to this app, as per [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17497947/is-there-a-way-to-set-a-default-app-for-heroku-toolbet)

I set the app to the custom (sub)domain [thesis.calebfergie.com](thesis.calebfergie.com) by following [this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains). I personally manage the 'calebfergie.com' domain through DreamHost, so I followed [these instructions](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000760591-Setting-your-domain-to-DNS-Only-) to help complete the process.
