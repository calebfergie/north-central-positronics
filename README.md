# North Central Positronics

A game built with [Twine](https://twinery.org/).

Created with node.js/express and automatically deployed to Heroku using the [node-js-getting-started](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) guide, [example app](https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started), and [GitHub integration guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration).

I also added [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to develop with greater ease locally.
